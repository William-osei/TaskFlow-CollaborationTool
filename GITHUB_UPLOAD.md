# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TaskFlow-CollaborationTool.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload
1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should see all files uploaded
3. Check that README.md displays properly
4. Verify database files are included (in backend/instance/)
